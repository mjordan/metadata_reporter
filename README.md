# Metadata Reporter

Script to report on various aspects of metadata retrieved via OAI-PMH. Currently in inital development.

## System requirements and installation

To install and run this script, you will need:

* PHP 5.5.0 or higher command-line interface
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

To install the reporter:

* Clone the Git repo
* `cd metadata_reporter`
* `php composer.phar install` (or equivalent on your system, e.g., `./composer install`)

## Usage

Run `./reporter test.ini`, where 'test.ini' specifies an output directory, an OAI-PMH entpoint, and a setSpec.

```
[general]
output_dir = test

[oai]
endpoint = http://digital.lib.sfu.ca/oai2
set_spec = hiv_collection
```

The script will output something like the following:

```
